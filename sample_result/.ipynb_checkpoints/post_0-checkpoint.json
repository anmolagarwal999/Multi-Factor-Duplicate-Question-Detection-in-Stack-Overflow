Or if there is some other way to get Subclipse to work with the very newest version of Subversion?</p>\n\n<p>I know this isn't necessarily a \"programming\" question, but I hope it's ok since it's highly relevant to the programming experience...</p>\n", "CommentCount": "0", "CreationDate": "2008-08-01T13:56:33.837", "Id": "79", "LastActivityDate": "2011-08-24T06:53:11.577", "LastEditDate": "2011-08-24T06:53:11.577", "LastEditorDisplayName": "Gaius", "LastEditorUserId": "561309", "OwnerUserId": "58", "PostTypeId": "1", "Score": "8", "Tags": "<eclipse><svn><aptana><subclipse>", "Title": "How can you get Subclipse in Aptana to work with the newest release of Subversion?", "ViewCount": "8673"}, "80": {"AcceptedAnswerId": "124", "AnswerCount": "3", "Body": "<p>I've written a database generation script in sql, and want to execute it in my Adobe air application:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Create Table tRole (\n    roleID integer Primary Key\n    ,roleName varchar(40)\n);\nCreate Table tFile (  \n    fileID integer Primary Key\n    ,fileName varchar(50)\n    ,fileDescription varchar(500)\n    ,thumbnailID integer\n    ,fileFormatID integer\n    ,categoryID integer\n    ,isFavorite boolean\n    ,dateAdded date\n    ,globalAccessCount integer\n    ,lastAccessTime date\n    ,downloadComplete boolean\n    ,isNew boolean\n    ,isSpotlight boolean\n    ,duration varchar(30)\n); \nCreate Table tCategory (  \n    categoryID integer Primary Key\n    ,categoryName varchar(50)\n    ,parent_categoryID integer\n);\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I execute this in Air using the following methods:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public static function RunSqlFromFile(fileName:String):void {\n        var file:File = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath(fileName);\n        var stream:FileStream = new FileStream();\n        stream.open(file, FileMode.READ)\n        var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);      \n        NonQuery(strSql);\n\n    }\n\n    public static function NonQuery(strSQL:String):void\n    {\n        var sqlConnection:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection();\n        sqlConnection.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(DBPATH);\n        var sqlStatement:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement();\n        sqlStatement.text = strSQL;\n        sqlStatement.sqlConnection = sqlConnection;\n        try \n        {\n            sqlStatement.execute();\n        } \n        catch (error:SQLError)\n        {\n            Alert.show(error.toString());\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No errors are generated, however only <code>tRole</code> exists.

This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.</p>\n\n<p>You'll know that you have leaks when you start getting outofmemoryexceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (perfmon has nice memory counters). </p>\n\n<p>Understanding .NET's memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work (again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the ebook). Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object A registered to an event on object B, then object A will stick around until object B disappears because B holds a reference to A. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (<a href=\"http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_memory_profiler/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">red-gate ants profile</a>, JetBrains dotTrace, <a href=\"http://memprofiler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">memprofiler</a> are really good choices, or you can use the text-only windbg and sos, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).</p>\n\n<p>I believe unmanaged code is subject to typical memory leaks of unamanged code, except that references shared between the two are managed by the garbage collector.

This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>'s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>\n<li>Use <code>6.5</code>'s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>\n<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>\n<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>\n<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>\n<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>\n<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>'s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the <code>6.5 database</code> are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.

Again, these are <strong>not</strong> database dumps.  Rather, each script represents the <strong>changes</strong> necessary to move from one version to the next.  They're the script that you apply to your production database to \"upgrade\" it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Developer Sandbox Synchronization</h1>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database.

Using Javascript to hash the password is not safe. (TODO citation required). There's another secure method called <strong>SRP</strong> but it's patented and there aren't any good implementations available.</p>\n\n<h3>Storing passwords</h3>\n\n<p>Don't ever store passwords as plaintext in the database. Not even if you don't care about the security of your own site. Assume that some of your users will reuse the password of their online bank account. So, store the hashed password, and throw away the original. And make sure the password doesn't show up in access logs or application logs.The best hashing function seems to be <strong>bcrypt</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Hashes by themselves are also insecure. For instance, identical passwords mean identical hashes. Instead, store the <strong>salted</strong> hash. A salt is a string appended to the hash - use a different (random) salt per user. The salt is a public value, so you can store them with the hash in the database.</p>\n\n<p>This means that you can't send the user their forgotten passwords (because you only have the hash). Don't reset the user's password unless you have authenticated the user (users must prove that they know the answer to the security question, or are able to read emails sent to the stored (and validated) email address.)</p>\n\n<h3>Security questions</h3>\n\n<p>Security questions are insecure - avoid using them. Why? Read <strong><em>PART III: Using Secret Questions</em></strong> in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/549/the-definitive-guide-to-forms-based-website-authentication/477578#477578\">@Jens Roland answer</a> here in this Wiki.</p>\n\n<h3>Session cookies</h3>\n\n<p>After the user logs in, the server sends the user a session cookie. The server can retrieve the username or id from the cookie, but nobody else can generate such a cookie (TODO explain mechanisms). Cookies can be hijacked (TODO really? how?), so don't send persistent cookies. If you want to autologin your users, you can set a persistent cookie, but you should set a flag that the user has auto-logged in, and needs to login for real for sensitive operations (TODO is this correct? I think this is what Amazon does.)</p>\n\n<h3>List of external resources</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/webauth%3asec10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dos and Don'ts of Client Authentication on the Web (PDF)</a><br>\n21 page academic article with many great tips.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=205572\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ask YC: Best Practices for User Authentication</a><br>\nForum discussion on the subject  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000953.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">You're Probably Storing Passwords Incorrectly</a><br>\nIntroductory article about storing passwords</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=55660\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discussion: Coding Horror: You're Probably Storing Passwords Incorrectly</a><br>\nForum discussion about CodingHorror article.</li>\n<li>Never store passwords in a database!<br>\nAnother warning about storing passwords in the database.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking\" rel=\"nofollow\">Password cracking</a><br>\nWikipedia article on weaknesses of several password hashing schemes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2007/9/7/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-s.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enough With The Rainbow Tables: What You Need To Know About Secure Password Schemes</a><br>\nDiscussion about rainbow tables and how to defend against them, and against other threads.

I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more <em>au fait</em> with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(n);<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return queue.remove();<br>}<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Deque queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();<br>}<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>", "CommentCount": "1", "CreationDate": "2008-08-03T02:32:50.690", "Id": "608", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-03T05:10:24.710", "LastEditDate": "2008-08-03T05:10:24.710", "LastEditorDisplayName": "Chris Jester-Young", "LastEditorUserId": "13", "OwnerUserId": "13", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "12", "ViewCount": ""}, "609": {"AnswerCount": "6", "Body": "<p>An MFC application that I'm trying to migrate uses <code>afxext.h</code>, which causes <code>_AFXDLL</code> to get set, which causes this error if I set <code>/MT</code>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Please use the /MD switch for _AFXDLL builds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My research to date indicates that it is impossible to build an application for execution on Windows NT 4.0 using Visual Studio (C++, in this case) 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Is this really true?

You can be great at testing because not only can you find all the little wacky problems, but you could pop open the code and find the areas causing the problems (possibly) and point them out even if you can't fix them.

I'll submit a bug report with this info\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you got in over your head and started submitting all this bad code and brazenly demanding it get included, then you are <em>making</em> a hindrance of yourself.

When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That should answer your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement<strong>, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.</strong>  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000\" rel=\"nofollow\">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk\" rel=\"nofollow\">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p>", "CreationDate": "2008-08-03T15:47:22.100", "Id": "735", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-03T15:47:22.100", "OwnerUserId": "145", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "-1", "ViewCount": ""}, "737": {"Body": "<p>It sounds like ADO/Access is perfect for your needs.

I urge the reader to read other answers and comments. I still stand by my original opinion that it doesn't matter for Gravatars, but there are definitely good arguments to the contrary as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This answer was written over a year ago. See my addendum at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>@ICR: It <strong>IS</strong> absolutely impossible, no \"but\".</p>\n\n<p>A Rainbow Table helps to get a match for a given Hash, but you will <strong>NEVER</strong> be able to get the exact input (well, there is indeed a chance of 1 to unlimited to get it, but you would not know whether or not that was the exact input). If you could get the exact Input from a 128-Bit Hash, you would just have invented the best compression algorhithm in the world.</p>\n\n<p>There are unlimited possibilities that will all produce the exact same hash.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain a bit more in detail.\nImage a Hash algorithm where \"foo\" and \"bar\" will result in the same hash, let's say \"HAsh1!\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, you get the Hash - HAsh1!. How do you know if the input data was \"foo\" or \"bar\"? You can't, and you will never ever be able to.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what is the problem and what are rainbow tables used for?</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you hack my user database, and you check the Users-Table.\nMy Login is usually stored in cleartext, so you know to log in with \"mstum\".\nBut my password is hashed. I used \"trez\" with incidentially also hashes to HAsh1!.</p>\n\n<p>You check my hashed password, which us HAsh1!, but you do not know that my plaintext password is trez.\nBut the point: You don't NEED to know that. You grab your Rainbow Table for HAsh1! and see \"foo\".</p>\n\n<p>So you go to the page you just got the user data for, and you log in as \"mstum\" with \"foo\". Despite me having used \"trez\" as password, you will successfully log in with \"foo\" because the hash is exactly the same.</p>\n\n<p>This is called a colision: 2 Input Values having the same hash. On MD5, there are only 128 Bit, whereas on SHA-512 there are 512 Bit, but you WILL still have infinite inputs which will result in the same hash.</p>\n\n<p>So: Rainbow tables solve one of the two problems hackers want to solve - it allows them to authenticate as any user they got the hash for.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem that hackers have is a bit off-topic: How do you give the user some file (for example, a manipulated Setup File that includes Malware or that is a modified version of a tool that does bad stuff) that will successfully have the same Hash? When you check some popular download pages or open source sites, they will have \"Setup.exe, MD5 Hash: f387......\". While there WILL BE infinite possibilities to produce something that hashes to f387..., the hacker needs to modify the Setup.exe in a way that it contains his Malware AND hashes to f387.... This hard, but possible. On MD5, this is now possible with a reasonable timeframe, which is why MD5 should not be used anymore unless a standard requires it or if security is not a concern.</p>\n\n<p>For Gravatar, Security does not need to be a concern, so MD5 is fine and <strong>they</strong> want something that is fast since it's not security-related.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Here is a real world example, the one that was used to show collisions in MD5:</p>\n\n<pre>\nd131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab5<strong>8</strong>712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89 \n55ad340609f4b30283e4888325<strong>7</strong>1415a 085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbd<strong>f</strong>280373c5b \nd8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e2<strong>b</strong>487da03fd02396306d248cda0 \ne99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080<strong>a</strong>80d1e c69821bcb6a8839396f965<strong>2</strong>b6ff72a70\n</pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre>\nd131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab5<strong>0</strong>712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89 \n55ad340609f4b30283e4888325<strong>f</strong>1415a 085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbd<strong>7</strong>280373c5b \nd8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e2<strong>3</strong>487da03fd02396306d248cda0 \ne99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080<strong>2</strong>80d1e c69821bcb6a8839396f965<strong>a</strong>b6ff72a70 \n</pre>\n\n<p>both hash to 79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4.</p>\n\n<p>So, given the hash - how do you know which one of the two was used?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> I still stand by my original point: Decoding an e-Mail address from a Hash is impossible. You can brute force or use a rainbow table and you might get lucky to get an e-Mail address. As there are infinite inputs to a hash, there are consequently also infinite inputs that look like an e-mail address, but the chances of getting a valid one are really insignificant. So decoding from Hash is not an option. But there are some options that I haven't originally considered, outlined for example <a href=\"http://www.developer.it/post/gravatars-why-publishing-your-email-s-hash-is-not-a-good-idea\">here</a>. Basically, you can guess. I post with my real name, so you can try all sorts of combinations of michaelstum@, mstum@, michael.stum@ with all the big providers and run them through a hash function. This does not work in all cases, but as many people use GMail, Yahoo or Hotmail, the chance to hit is not that low. Would salting solve that? Maybe. Maybe not. You would have to figure out the salt, which almost certainly requires brute-force approaches. At least you have a known plaintext (your own e-Mail address), so you can run this brute force on your machine. Having a different salt per-user might be more secure, but I don't know if that could cause a significant risk of creating collisions.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about this, I think that salting with a long, random salt would indeed improve security as it defeats the one viable approach of guessing. I'd rather recommend using disposable/different e-Mail addresses as you never know what can happen (website databases get hacked every day, and those e-Mail addresses are certainly sold to spammers), but I realize that is impractical for people without a domain and a catchall-mailbox.</p>\n", "CommentCount": "19", "CreationDate": "2008-08-03T15:49:53.560", "Id": "738", "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-01T10:29:11.233", "LastEditDate": "2011-01-01T10:29:11.233", "LastEditorDisplayName": "edg", "LastEditorUserId": "91", "OwnerUserId": "91", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "42", "ViewCount": ""}, "739": {"Body": "<p>We have been using Sharpmap with a Silverlight 2.0 control that we developed in house.

But is also not worse. It's different.</p>\n\n<p>The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.</p>\n\n<p>With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.</p>\n\n<p>With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.</p>\n\n<p>This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.</p>\n\n<p>Git seems to be the \"new, shiny, cool\" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the \"Distributed Source Control\" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.</p>\n\n<p>Subversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple \"svnadmin create\", Git's \"git init\" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the \"proper\" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the \"checkout\" command is very confusing to people changing over - the \"proper\" way seems to be \"git clone\", while \"git checkout\" seems to switch branches.</p>\n\n<p>Git REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named \"origin\").</p>\n\n<p>As said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with \"the server\" (I'm assuming most people still like a central \"master-repository\").</p>\n\n<p>Also, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit.</p>\n\n<p>SVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on.</p>\n\n<p>Git has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written).</p>\n\n<p>This also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic.</p>\n\n<p>What I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN.</p>\n\n<p>But even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for \"Offline Source Control\" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.</p>\n", "CommentCount": "33", "CreationDate": "2008-08-03T22:45:44.533", "Id": "875", "LastActivityDate": "2009-12-28T04:45:25.160", "LastEditDate": "2009-12-28T04:45:25.160", "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditorUserId": "91", "OwnerUserId": "91", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "550", "ViewCount": ""}, "876": {"Body": "<p>Well, it's distributed.

This represents a snapshot in time of what the repository looks like. You update your working copy via updates, and you update the repository via commits.</p>\n\n<p>With a distributed version control, you don't have a snapshot, but rather the entire codebase. Wanna do a diff with a 3 month old version? No problem, the 3 month old version is still on your computer. This doesn't only mean things are way faster, but if you're disconnected from your central server, you can still do many of the operations you're used to. In other words, you don't just have a snapshot of a given revision, but the entire codebase.</p>\n\n<p>You'd think that Git would take up a bunch of space on your harddrive, but from a couple benchmarks I've seen, it actually takes less.

I am happy with Versions for now, and will probably pay for it when it launches. The main loss for me is the built in diff-window in Cornerstone - that's nice - but the clunky management of working copies separately from repositories is something I found really bad with things like svnX and I think that's a clear win for Versions. </p>\n\n<p>Diffing is so important that every developer should have a good tool.

An escape string constant is specified by writing the letter E (upper or lower case) just before the opening single quote, e.g. E'foo'. (When continuing an escape string constant across lines, write E only before the first opening quote.) Within an escape string, a backslash character (\\) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in which the combination of backslash and following character(s) represents a special byte value. \\b is a backspace, \\f is a form feed, \\n is a newline, \\r is a carriage return, \\t is a tab. Also supported are \\digits, where digits represents an octal byte value, and \\xhexdigits, where hexdigits represents a hexadecimal byte value. (It is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding.) Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to include a backslash character, write two backslashes (\\\\). Also, a single quote can be included in an escape string by writing \\', in addition to the normal way of ''.</p>\r\n</blockquote>", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T01:14:57.367", "Id": "943", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-04T01:14:57.367", "OwnerUserId": "91", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "7", "ViewCount": ""}, "944": {"AcceptedAnswerId": "1016", "AnswerCount": "5", "Body": "<p>I'm maintaining a .NET 1.1 application, and one of the things I've been tasked with is making sure the user doesn't see any unfriendly error notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've added handlers to Application.ThreadException and AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException, which do get called.

The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>\n\n<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>\n\n<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>\n\n<p>Now here's the rub:<br>\nWhen it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an alloc; when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, VS2008/MSVC9 or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above 50%, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming 1.3G of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an E6550 Core2 Duo); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>\n<li>Rewrite operators new and delete to use VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under MSVC6 and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites new and delete?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>\n\n<p>A collegue just walked past and asked \"Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?\"</p>\n\n<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update: balancing new[] and delete[] seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>\n\n<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the STL implementation that ships with VS98.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Reproduce the problem.

These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn\u2019t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires N/2 block accesses, where N is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn\u2019t contain unique entries) then the entire table space must be searched at N block accesses.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, this has log2 N block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn\u2019t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is indexing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.</p>\n\n<p>The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk, since the indexes are stored together in a MyISAM database, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Firstly, let\u2019s outline a sample database table schema; </p>\n\n<pre>\nField name       Data type      Size on disk\nid (Primary key) Unsigned INT   4 bytes\nfirstName        Char(50)       50 bytes\nlastName         Char(50)       50 bytes\nemailAddress     Char(100)      100 bytes\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value. \nThis sample database contains five million rows, and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the id (a sorted key field) and one using the firstName (a non-key unsorted field).</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Example 1</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Given our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records of a fixed size giving a record length of R = 204 bytes and they are stored in a MyISAM database which is using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/204 = 5 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/5 = 1,000,000 blocks. </p>\n\n<p>A linear search on the id field would require an average of N/2 = 500,000 block accesses to find a value given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of log2 1000000 = 19.93 = 20 block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Now the firstName field is neither sorted, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact N = 1,000,000 block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct.</p>\n\n<p>Given that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks that the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the firstName field is outlined below; </p>\n\n<pre>\nField name       Data type      Size on disk\nfirstName        Char(50)       50 bytes\n(record pointer) Special        4 bytes\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Example 2</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Given our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records with an index record length of R = 54 bytes and using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/54 = 18 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/18 = 277,778 blocks. </p>\n\n<p>Now a search using the firstName field can utilise the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of log2 277778 = 18.08 = 19 block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to 19 + 1 = 20 block accesses, a far cry from the 277,778 block accesses required by the non-indexed table.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When should it be used?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index.</p>\n\n<p>Since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.</p>\n", "CommentCount": "10", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T10:41:04.620", "Id": "1130", "LastActivityDate": "2012-02-07T10:09:41.550", "LastEditDate": "2012-02-07T10:09:41.550", "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditorUserId": "264", "OwnerUserId": "264", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "337", "ViewCount": ""}, "1131": {"AcceptedAnswerId": "1135", "AnswerCount": "10", "Body": "<p>Back in the old days, Help was not trivial but possible: generate some funky .rtf file with special tags, run it through a compiler, and you got a WinHelp file (.hlp) that actually works really well.</p>\n\n<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>\n\n<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice \"Navigation to the webpage was canceled\" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable.

The immediate advantages that come to mind are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Running the tests becomes automate-able and repeatable</li>\r\n<li>You can test at a much more granular level than point-and-click testing via a GUI</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that if your test code writes to a file, opens a database connection or does something over the network, it's more appropriately categorized as an integration test. Integration tests are a good thing, but should not be confused with unit tests. Unit test code should be short, sweet and quick to execute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to look at unit testing is that you write the tests first. This is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD for short). TDD brings additional advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You don't write speculative \"I might need this in the future\" code -- just enough to make the tests pass</li>\r\n<li>The code you've written is always covered by tests</li>\r\n<li>By writing the test first, you're forced into thinking about how you want to call the code, which usually improves the design of the code in the long run.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're not doing unit testing now, I recommend you get started on it. Get a good book, practically any xUnit-book will do because the concepts are very much transferable between them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes writing unit tests can be painful. When it gets that way, try to find someone to help you, and resist the temptation to \"just write the damn code\". Unit testing is a lot like washing the dishes.

The default character set on Windows XP (English) is Cp1252. On the web, you don't know what a browser will send you (though hopefully your container will handle most of this). And don't be surprised when there are bugs in whatever implementation you are using. Character sets can have interesting interactions with filenames when they move to between machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translating Strings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translators are, generally speaking, not coders. If you send a source file to a translator, they will break it. Strings should be extracted to resource files (e.g. properties files in Java or resource DLLs in Visual C++). Translators should be given files that are difficult to break and tools that don't let them break them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translators do not know where strings come from in a product. It is difficult to translate a string without context. If you do not provide guidance, the quality of the translation will suffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While on the subject of context, you may see the same string \"foo\" crop up in multiple times and think it would be more efficient to have all instances in the UI point to the same resource. This is a bad idea. Words may be very context-sensitive in some languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translating strings costs money. If you release a new version of a product, it makes sense to recover the old versions. Have tools to recover strings from your old resource files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>String concatenation and manual manipulation of strings should be minimized. Use the format functions where applicable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translators need to be able to modify hotkeys. Ctrl+P is print in English; the Germans use Ctrl+D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a translation process that requires someone to manually cut and paste strings at any time, you are asking for trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dates, Times, Calendars, Currency, Number Formats, Time Zones</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These can all vary from country to country. A comma may be used to denote decimal places. Times may be in 24hour notation. Not everyone uses the Gregorian calendar. You need to be unambiguous, too. If you take care to display dates as MM/DD/YYYY for the USA and DD/MM/YYYY for the UK on your website, the dates are ambiguous unless the user knows you've done it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Especially Currency</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Locale functions provided in the class libraries will give you the local currency symbol, but you can't just stick a pound (sterling) or euro symbol in front of a value that gives a price in dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>User Interfaces</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Layout should be dynamic. Not only are strings likely to double in length on translation, the entire UI may need to be inverted (Hebrew; Arabic) so that the controls run from right to left. And that is before we get to Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Testing Prior To Translation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use static analysis of your code to locate problems. At a bare minimum, leverage the tools built into your IDE. (Eclipse users can go to Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Errors/Warnings and check for non-externalised strings.)</li>\r\n<li>Smoke test by simulating translation. It isn't difficult to parse a resource file and replace strings with a pseudo-translated version that doubles the length and inserts funky characters. You don't have to speak a language to use a foreign operating system. Modern systems should let you log in as a foreign user with translated strings and foreign locale. If you are familiar with your OS, you can figure out what does what without knowing a single word of the language.</li>\r\n<li>Keyboard maps and character set references are very useful.</li>\r\n<li>Virtualisation would be very useful here.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non-technical Issues</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes you have to be sensitive to cultural differences (offence or incomprehension may result). A mistake you often see is the use of flags as a visual cue choosing a website language or geography. Unless you want your software to declare sides in global politics, this is a bad idea. If you were French and offered the option for English with St. George's flag (the flag of England is a red cross on a white field), this might result in confusion for many English speakers - assume similar issues will arise with foreign languages and countries. Icons need to be vetted for cultural relevance. What does a thumbs-up or a green tick mean? Language should be relatively neutral - addressing users in a particular manner may be acceptable in one region, but considered rude in another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C++ and Java programmers may find the ICU website useful: <a href=\"http://www.icu-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.icu-project.org/</a></p>", "CommentCount": "3", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T17:58:02.130", "Id": "1462", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-04T18:07:48.507", "LastEditDate": "2008-08-04T18:07:48.507", "LastEditorDisplayName": "McDowell", "LastEditorUserId": "304", "OwnerUserId": "304", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "40", "ViewCount": ""}, "1464": {"Body": "<p>Like Rob Allen, I use SQL Compare / Data Compare by Redgate.

For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));<br>bool success = false;<br>while (!success)<br>{<br>    try<br>    {<br>        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail<br>        success = true;<br>    }<br>    catch (IOException e)<br>    {<br>        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)<br>        {<br>            throw e;<br>        }<br>        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()<br>    {<br>        // some code block<br>    } );<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

I would say unit testing is the practice of writing software tests to verify that your real software does what it is meant to. This started with <a href=\"http://junit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jUnit</a> in the Java world and has become a best practice in PHP as well with <a href=\"http://simpletest.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SimpleTest</a> and <a href=\"http://www.phpunit.de/\" rel=\"nofollow\">phpUnit</a>. It's a core practice of Extreme Programming and helps you to be sure that your software still works as intended after editing. If you have sufficient test coverage, you can do major refactoring, bug fixing or add features rapidly with much less fear of introducing other problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's most effective when all unit tests can be run automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unit testing is generally associated with OO development. The basic idea is to create a script which sets up the environment for your code and then exercises it; you write assertions, specify the intended output that you should receive and then execute your test script using a framework such as those mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test. phpUnit is run from the Linux command line by default, though there are HTTP interfaces available for it. SimpleTest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running, IMO. In combination with xDebug, phpUnit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's good practice to keep your unit tests in the same repository as your application.</p>", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T23:53:16.440", "Id": "1718", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-04T23:53:16.440", "OwnerUserId": "137", "PostTypeId": "2", "Score": "2", "ViewCount": ""}, "1721": {"Body": "<p>I'd suggest against passing an integer between them, simply for purposes of readability and debugging.

I'd highly recommend that you investigate a unit testing framework for your chosen language (I can't recommend a Python one I'm sorry) and build a <strong>Model</strong> of the little organisms without any UI. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps make it an object with a method on it that moves the Game of Life forward by one step and exposes a two-dimensional array of where all the creatures are at any given moment. This way you can add a timer later on that moves the game forward at a variable speed (useful for Game of Life).</p>\n\n<p>Once the Model is working you can build a simple UI which \"watches\" the model of the little organisms and displays them to you (the user). This will be easier if the model can notify observers when it changes (like at a timestep). At this point you are sure that the Game of Life bits are working and you can concentrate on the UI (the <strong>View</strong> to be precise).</p>\n\n<p>If you want to add some user control then add in a new component to respond to user events and have it update the model directly.
